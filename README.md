# Educational Data Structures Project

An educational Python project implementing Stack, Queue, and Linked List data structures with comprehensive documentation and software construction principles.

## üìö Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of three fundamental data structures in Python:
- **Stack** - Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure
- **Queue** - First In, First Out (FIFO) data structure  
- **Linked List** - Dynamic linear data structure with nodes

The project emphasizes educational value through extensive documentation, clear code organization, and practical demonstrations of how these data structures work together in real-world scenarios.

## üéØ Educational Objectives

### Data Structure Implementation
- ‚úÖ **Stack Operations**: push, pop, peek, is_empty, size, display
- ‚úÖ **Queue Operations**: enqueue, dequeue, front, rear, is_empty, size, display
- ‚úÖ **Linked List Operations**: insert (multiple positions), delete, search, display, size

### Software Construction Principles Applied
- ‚úÖ **Modular Design**: Each data structure in separate module
- ‚úÖ **High Cohesion**: Each class performs single, well-defined task
- ‚úÖ **Low Coupling**: Minimal dependencies between modules
- ‚úÖ **Clear Naming**: Descriptive variable and function names
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Comprehensive comments and docstrings
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Proper exception handling for edge cases

## üîß How to Run

1. Clone or download the project files
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the main demonstration:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

The program will run comprehensive demonstrations of all three data structures and their interactions.

## üìã Detailed Implementation Breakdown

### Sub-Step 1: Modular Design Implementation

**How it was incorporated:**
- Created separate Python files for each data structure (`stack.py`, `queue.py`, `linkedlist.py`)
- Each module contains only one class with its related functionality
- Clean import statements in `main.py` demonstrate module separation
- Each module can be run independently for individual testing

**Benefits achieved:**
- Easy maintenance and testing of individual components
- Code reusability across different projects
- Clear separation of concerns

### Sub-Step 2: High Cohesion Implementation

**How it was incorporated:**
- Each class performs a single, well-defined task:
  - `Stack` class: Only handles LIFO operations
  - `Queue` class: Only handles FIFO operations  
  - `LinkedList` class: Only handles dynamic list operations
  - `DataStructureManager` class: Only coordinates demonstrations
- Methods within each class are focused on specific operations
- No method performs multiple unrelated tasks

**Benefits achieved:**
- Clear understanding of what each component does
- Easy debugging and testing
- Reduced complexity in each module

### Sub-Step 3: Low Coupling Implementation

**How it was incorporated:**
- Minimal dependencies between modules - each data structure is independent
- No circular imports or tight dependencies
- Main application uses composition pattern to combine structures
- Each data structure can function without knowledge of others
- Clean interfaces through public methods only

**Benefits achieved:**
- Components can be modified independently
- Easy to replace or extend individual data structures
- Reduced risk of cascading changes

### Sub-Step 4: Clear and Meaningful Naming

**How it was incorporated:**
- **Classes**: `Stack`, `Queue`, `LinkedList`, `Node`, `DataStructureManager`
- **Methods**: `push()`, `pop()`, `enqueue()`, `dequeue()`, `insert_at_beginning()`
- **Variables**: `current_task`, `processed_item`, `front_item`, `new_node`
- **Constants**: Clear descriptive names like `data_items`, `completed_tasks`
- **Private attributes**: Prefixed with underscore (`_items`, `_size`)

**Benefits achieved:**
- Self-documenting code that's easy to read
- Reduced need for extensive comments
- Clear intent and purpose of each component

### Sub-Step 5: Readable Code with Documentation

**How it was incorporated:**
- **Comprehensive docstrings**: Every class and method includes detailed documentation
- **Inline comments**: Line-by-line explanations of complex operations
- **Method documentation**: Parameters, return values, and exceptions clearly documented
- **Module headers**: Description of purpose, author, and date
- **Example usage**: Each module includes demonstration code
- **Consistent formatting**: Proper indentation and spacing throughout

**Example of comprehensive documentation:**
```python
def push(self, item):
    """
    Add an element to the top of the stack.
    
    This operation has O(1) time complexity as we append to the end of the list.
    
    Args:
        item: The element to be added to the stack (can be any data type)
    
    Returns:
        None
    """
    # Append the item to the end of the list (top of stack)
    self._items.append(item)
    print(f"Pushed '{item}' onto the stack")
```

### Sub-Step 6: Main Integration File (main.py)

**How it was incorporated:**
- **Imports all modules**: Demonstrates integration of separate components
- **DataStructureManager class**: Coordinates usage of all three data structures
- **Multiple demonstration scenarios**:
  1. Basic operations for each structure
  2. Integration scenario (task processing system)
  3. Data flow between structures
  4. Error handling and edge cases
- **Real-world applications**: Shows practical usage patterns
- **Educational output**: Extensive console output explaining each step

**Key integration features:**
- Task processing system using all three structures
- Data transfer between different structures
- Undo operations using stack
- Queue-based task processing
- History tracking with linked list

## üèóÔ∏è Software Construction Principles Demonstrated

### 1. Encapsulation
- **Private attributes**: Internal data hidden with underscore prefix (`_items`, `_size`)
- **Public interfaces**: Clean method APIs for external interaction
- **Data protection**: Internal structure cannot be directly modified

### 2. Error Handling
- **Exception handling**: Try-catch blocks for edge cases
- **Input validation**: Boundary checking for positions and operations
- **Informative error messages**: Clear feedback for invalid operations
- **Graceful degradation**: System continues working after errors

### 3. Code Reusability
- **Independent modules**: Each structure can be used in other projects
- **Standard interfaces**: Common method patterns across structures
- **Composition support**: Easy to combine structures in different ways

### 4. Maintainability
- **Clear structure**: Easy to locate and modify specific functionality
- **Comprehensive tests**: Each module includes test scenarios
- **Version control friendly**: Changes isolated to specific files
